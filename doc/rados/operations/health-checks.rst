Health checks
=============

Overview
========

There is a finite set of possible health messages that a Ceph cluster can
raise -- these are defined as *health checks* which have unique identifiers.

The identifier is a terse pseudo-human-readable (i.e. like a variable name)
string.  It is intended to enable tools (such as UIs) to make sense of
health checks, and present them in a way that reflects their meaning.

This page lists the health checks that are raised by the monitor and manager
daemons.  In addition to these, you may also see health checks that originate
from MDS daemons (see :doc:`/cephfs/health-messages`), and health checks
that are defined by ceph-mgr python modules.

OSDs

OSD_DOWN
________

One or more OSDs are marked down

OSD_<crush type>_DOWN 
_____________________

(e.g. OSD_HOST_DOWN, OSD_ROOT_DOWN)

All the OSDs within a particular CRUSH subtree are marked down, for example
all OSDs on a host.

POOL_APP_NOT_ENABLED
____________________

A pool exists that contains one or more objects but has not been
tagged for use by a particular application.

Resolve this warning by labeling the pool for use by an application.  For
example, if the pool is used by RBD,::

  rbd pool init <poolname>

If the pool is being used by a custom application 'foo', you can also label
via the low-level command::

  ceph osd pool application enable foo

For more information, see :doc:`pools.rst#associate-pool-to-application`.
